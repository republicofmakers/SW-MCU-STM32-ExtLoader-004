# SW-MCU-STM32-ExtLoader-006


Here is a project file to create external loader for STM32 microcontrollers.


![external loader](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf0c62a3-2ae2-4d12-9457-17f7064fff2c)


It uses external flash (W25Q64) and it is connected to stm32h743 via QSPI.


You can edit the code and can create your external loader.

Hope this helps you,
